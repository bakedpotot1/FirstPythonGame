# Murder Mystery Text Game (Python)

A text-based murder mystery game built in Python as a learning project.
Explore rooms, speak to NPCs, uncover clues, and solve the case.

## Why I Built This

I built this project as a personal learning exercise while teaching myself Python.
I wanted to:
- Practice core Python fundamentals
- Learn how to structure a multi-file project
- Build a complete, playable program from scratch

I also wanted to create something fun that I could share with others.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
3. Navigate to the project folder

The game runs entirely in the terminal.

## Features

- Multiple explorable rooms
- NPCs with unique dialogue
- Clue discovery system
- Game state tracking
- Simple text-based navigation

## Project Structure

- `main.py` – Game entry point
- `state.py` – Manages game state
- `data.py` – Shared game data
- `utils.py` – Helper functions
- `npc/` – NPC logic and dialogue
- `rooms/` – Room definitions and interactions

## What I Learned

- Working with functions across multiple files
- Using dictionaries to manage game data
- Managing shared state in a program
- Writing clear, readable logic
- Debugging and problem-solving through iteration

## Possible Future Improvements

- Refactor NPC and room logic to reduce repetition
- Add inventory system
- Improve input validation
- Expand story and dialogue
- Add dialog log
